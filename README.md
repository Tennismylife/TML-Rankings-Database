## Repository Description

This repository collects **all ATP rankings from the Open Era**.

The official rankings are available on the ATP website and stored in the **`Official ATP Rankings`** folder. However, many of these contain missing information, which has been completed as follows:

### 1973–1984
During this period, ATP rankings were not published on a weekly basis. Thanks to the work of **Slasher1985**, found online, it has been possible to reconstruct the week-by-week rankings and add them to the database.

### 1990–1996
For these years, the rankings are complete in terms of positions but missing the points data. The missing information has been retrieved from [Ultimate Tennis Statistics](https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com).
